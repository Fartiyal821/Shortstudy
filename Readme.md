## Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies

#### HTML5
All pages are built using semantic HTML5 markup, ensuring proper document structure and accessibility. The HTML is clean, well-organized, and follows accessibility best practices including proper heading hierarchy and ARIA attributes where necessary.

#### CSS3
The styling is implemented using modern CSS3 features including:
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- CSS Variables for dynamic theming
- CSS Transitions and Animations for smooth user interactions
- Media Queries for responsive design across all device sizes
- Custom properties for theme switching (light/dark mode)

#### JavaScript (Vanilla)
The interactivity is powered by vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks), making the site lightweight and fast. The JavaScript handles:
- Navigation and direct page links
- Theme switching and persistence
- User interface interactions
- Responsive mobile menu toggling
- Page-specific functionality

### Development Approach

The project uses a clean separation of concerns with:
- One main stylesheet (`style.css`) for global styles
- Page-specific stylesheets for unique styling needs
- One main JavaScript file (`script.js`) for shared functionality
- Page-specific JavaScript files for unique interactions

### Admin Panel Security

- **Password Protected**: Only users with password `123` can access
- **Session-based**: Session ends when user closes browser or clicks Logout
- **Hidden from navigation**: The admin panel doesn't appear in the main menu
- **Not indexed**: Search engines cannot find this page

⚠️ **Security Note**: Change the password `123` in production! Edit `admin.js` line 3 to set a stronger password.

### Data Storage

- All course data is stored in **browser's localStorage**
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Each browser/device has its own separate data
- **To backup**: Export the browser's localStorage or keep a file copy
- **To clear**: Use browser's Storage/Cache settings

### Course Files

**New files created:**
- `admin.html` - Admin panel interface
- `admin.js` - Admin panel logic
- `admin.css` - Admin panel styling
- `course-view.html` - Individual course page
- `course-view.css` - Course page styling
- `.htaccess` - URL routing for Apache servers

**Modified files:**
- `web.html` - Now loads courses dynamically
- `web.js` - Loads and displays courses from localStorage
- `web.css` - Added styling for course blocks
- `script.js` - Added routing logic for /g URL

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| `/g` doesn't work | Make sure `.htaccess` is in the root folder (Apache server) |
| Admin page shows error | Clear browser cache and sessionStorage |
| Courses don't appear | Check if JavaScript is enabled in browser |
| YouTube video doesn't show | Verify the embed link format is correct |
